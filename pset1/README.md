# Credit 
A program that detects fraudulent credit cards. All you have to do is enter the credit card number, if it is correct, the program will print its type (visa card, master card, Amex).
If it is fake, it will print (Invalid!)
# Mario
Enter an integer for the height value, and mario.c will print Mario's pyramid on the console.

This was my first dive into coding in C.
