# Blog-CS50-Recap & Final Project
hello all, this blog is about what i learned throught my walk in CS50 and my final project.
# What is CS50?
CS50 is probably the most popular of all programming courses, especially for beginners.
In 10 weeks, students learn different topics: Scratch, C, Arrays, Data Structures, Algorithms, Python, SQL, front-end and back-end, every week you learn to solve Labs and some problems.
At the end of the course, you have to create your final project.
# CS50 Course Content
1. Week 0: Computer science basics(Binary, what is an algorithm, Scratch...)
2. Week 1 --> Week 5: Everything you will learn in these five weeks, you will apply in C, 
C intro (if statements, for & while loops, functions, data types..), libraries, then you will learn searching and sorting algorithms, big O notation, and data structures(linked lists, tree, hash tables, tries...).
In these weeks, you will find it difficult to solve problems if the information is new to you.
3. Week 6: After learning C, you will learn high-level python, with simple syntax, and won't let you worry about some issues like data allocation, semi-columns, segmentation faults, this week focus on some Python topics like dictionaries, teach you how to handle possible CSV files In C but way harder. You have to learn in Python everything you learned in C
4. Week 7: This week will show you a more efficient way to store data. You will learn the basics of relational databases, SQL, SQLite. This week is full of fun problems.
5. Week 8: In this week you will learn the basics of the web (HTTP, TCP/IP...) and how to create a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with some bootstrap...
6. Week 9: This week you will learn about Frameworks, Flask in particular, and learn how to create a fully functional website using python-flask, in addition to what you learned in the previous weeks (SQLite, HTML, Js...).
Solving this problem will be very interesting because you have to use everything you learned in the course.
