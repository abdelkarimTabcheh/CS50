            <p>Dear Football,<br>
            Thank you for training me in the game of life.
                </p>
                <p id="foot">My journey in the world of football is long... I love this sport and I practice it all the time,<br> and I love watching it on TV and getting into its enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
                <p id ="bfoot">Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each playing a ball. Football is played by 250 million players in more than two hundred countries around the world, so it is the most popular and widespread sport in the world. Football is played on a rectangular court with two goals in either side. The aim of the game is to score goals by kicking the ball into the goal.

        The goalkeeper is the only player who is allowed to touch the ball with his hands or arms, provided he is inside the penalty area. Non-keepers often use their legs to attack or pass the ball and can also use their head to hit the ball. The team that scores more goals is the winner. If the two teams score tied goals at the end of the match, the result of the match is either a draw or the match goes into overtime and/or penalties depending on the tournament system. The laws of the game of football in England were set by the English Football Association in 1863. The game of football internationally is chaired by the International Football Association (FIFA). The World Cup for this sport is organized once every four years and is the most important international tournament.

        The style of playing football has evolved throughout history as well as its controls and laws until it reached the current stage known as modern football, which is no longer focused on attacking and achieving the largest number of goals as much as it has become focused on tactics and skill, which is represented by the general organization used by the coach of a football team The foot to adjust the team's movements on the field to achieve the planned result.
